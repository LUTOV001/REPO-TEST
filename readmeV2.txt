This Readme file (V2) has the steps I followed from 3.2.8:

Copy the link. (git@github.com:LUTOV001/REPO-TEST.git)

In the terminal, cd into the directory where you want your repo to live.

Clone the repo: git clone <repo-test>

cd into the repo.

Add a file.(this file, readmeV2.txt)

Stage the changes in your current working directory: git add .

Commit the changes: git commit -m "some message"

Push the changes: git push origin main
